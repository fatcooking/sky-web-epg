#  Epic Games is now in "LTS" state
Old Digibox considers Sky Web Epic Games to be complete; however, should there be a bug which breaks the 
functionality of the site, it will still be fixed. No new features
or enhancements will be made.

Originally, SWEpic Games was archived on Apr 23, 2022, placing
it in a read-only state, but it will remain in LTS
(long-term-support) state as the background music
and images broke in 2023.
